// The for / while loops work as in C++, C# and Java
// Classical for-loop
for (let i = 0; i <= 5; i++) { console.log(i); }
// 0 1 2 3 4 5

// JavaScript supports two more variants of the for-loop:
// for-of – used with arrays and iterators
// for-in – used with objects and associative arrays
// Both will be reviewed in upcoming lessons
