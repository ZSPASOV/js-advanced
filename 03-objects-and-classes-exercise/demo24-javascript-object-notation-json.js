// It's a data interchange format
// It's language independent - syntax is like JavaScript object syntax, but the JSON format is text only
// Is "self-describing" and easy to understand: 
{
    "employees": [
        { "firstName": "John", "lastName": "Doe" },
        { "firstName": "Anna", "lastName": "Smith" },
        { "firstName": "Peter", "lastName": "Jones" }
    ]
}
